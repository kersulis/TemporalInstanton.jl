# Temporal Instanton
This code was written to perform temporal instanton analysis as presented in Kersulis et al. [unpublished].

## Introduction
The code is tied together by the `solve_temporal_instanton` function. This function accepts an input of type `InstantonInputData` and returns an instance of `InstantonInputData`.

## Reading the code
The project directory is organized like a typical Julia package. All source code resides in `src/`, which stands alone. Data files used to put the source code through its paces are in `data/`.


## Organization
I will go through my notebooks in chronological order, skipping or briefly mentioning work that has been superseded.

I copied the nbs directory. I will now combine all the information into single narrative, deleting the nb copies as I go.

* 2015-02-28. Getting started. Early versions of a few matrix-building functions. Typeset description of how things are kept track of in matrix form.
