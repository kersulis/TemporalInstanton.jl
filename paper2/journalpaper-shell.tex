% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:

%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/

% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used

\begin{abstract}
%A time-coupled instanton method for characterizing transmission network vulnerability to wind generation fluctuation is presented. To extend prior instanton work to multiple-time-step analysis, line constraints are specified in terms of temperature rather than current. An optimization formulation is developed to express the minimum wind forecast deviation such that at least one line is driven to its thermal limit. Results are shown for an IEEE RTS-96 system with several wind-farms.
A previously-developed method for studying a transmission network's vulnerability to wind forecast inaccuracy is expanded. This method uses optimization to find a wind generation pattern close to the forecast that violates a specified line. Repeating the optimization for all lines in the network yields a set of generation patterns which may be sorted by likelihood. Instanton analysis thus yields insight into the potential effects of wind forecast inaccuracy at the system level.
% To demonstrate the practicability of this method, we present results for the RTS-96 and show how the method scales to larger networks.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\IEEEPARstart{A}{wind} forecast error that was once inconsequential can now be vexatious. As wind has grown into a major transmission-scale energy source, system operators find themselves frequently dealing with wind-induced network congestion \cite{rogers2010}. In certain cases this congestion may cause a transmission line to overheat and sag. System operators use wind forecast data to steer the network away from such scenarios, but wind forecasts are significantly less accurate than generation and demand predictions \cite{parsons2004}. How might forecast inaccuracies compound across a network to overheat transmission lines? How likely is this to occur? Temporal instanton analysis addresses these questions by identifying sag-inducing wind patterns and ranking them according to likelihood. The intersection of likely wind patterns with those that cause excessive line heating is of interest to system operators and planners, who may use this information to better prepare for renewable generation uncertainty.

Instanton analysis belongs to the family of ``distance to failure'' algorithms. It was introduced by \cite{chertkov2011} and \cite{chertkov2011a}, where the DC power flow approximation was used to represent a network's feasible operating region as a set of linear constraints. These constraints form the faces of a high-dimensional polytope; any feasible generation pattern corresponds to a point inside this geometric object. In this setting, distance to failure is intuitively understood to be the shortest distance between a given forecast operating point and the surface of the polytope. As shown in \cite{chertkov2011a}, one can use convex optimization to quickly find the unique shift in wind generation (if one exists) that will drive the network to a chosen face of the feasible region. Once every polytope face has been considered, the wind pattern corresponding to the shortest distance is termed the instanton; it is the smallest shift in wind generation that will drive the network to the brink of infeasibility.

Subsequent instanton analysis research falls into two categories. The first is exploration of the trade-off between accuracy and algorithm complexity. Replacing the DC power flow approximation with AC power balance, for instance, results in greater accuracy at the cost of convexity. There are no analytic solutions in this setting, so an iterative scheme is required \cite{baghsorkhi2012}. Between the DC and AC extremes are various power flow approximations (see \cite{coffrin2012,hijazi2013,coffrin2014} for examples) which may be used to enhance instanton analysis accuracy while maintaining problem convexity (and therefore solution guarantees). Regardless of the power flow model used, research in this category is ultimately focused on instantaneous vulnerability: find the smallest wind generation shift that drives a line to its power or current limit. This method uncovers previously hidden grid vulnerability, but raises a new question: would an instanton scenario persist until a transmission line sags, or might the network simply touch the boundary of the feasible region before returning to safe operation? This paper belongs to the category of temporal instanton analysis, whose aim is to answer this question.

It is safe to temporarily operate a line above its current limit. Transmission system operators know this and periodically allow lines to operate above their limits to promote smooth operation during congestion \cite{banakar2005}. It takes persistent extreme temperatures for line conductors to sag to an unacceptable level (as defined by statute and nearby tree limbs). As long as the line is allowed to cool before reaching this point, no harm will be done. Thus, if an operator is comfortable with temporarily overloaded lines, information from instantaneous instanton analysis may be too conservative to aid decision making.

In this paper we expound on temporal instanton analysis. The line temperature model we use is derived from \cite{ieee2013}. Ohmic loss heating is related to power flow angle differences according to a relationship from \cite{almassalkhi2014}. By modeling line temperature over an appropriate time horizon, the proposed method discovers multiple-time-step wind patterns that are both likely to occur and sure to induce excessive sag for at least one line in the network.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:models} describes the models at the core of temporal instanton analysis. Section \ref{sec:qcqp} combines these models into a quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP). The solution of this QCQP is described in Section \ref{sec:solution}. Section \ref{sec:implementation}  contains results for two networks: a modified version of the RTS-96 and the larger WECC network. The former network has been used in previous instanton analysis studies, while the latter serves to demonstrate scalability of temporal instanton analysis. Finally, an appendix contains a detailed description of the thermal model used to calculate line temperature.

We expand on prior work by providing a more detailed treatment of the objective function, discussing implementation details including computational complexity and sparsity, and proposing a particular algorithm for solving the secular equation.

\section{Models}\label{sec:models}
Temporal instanton analysis entwines three physical phenomena, each with its own model. Transmission line temperature requires a heat balance model; forecast error likelihood is quantified via a statistical model; and the feasible region of network operation is delineated using a network model. This section describes the three models in detail. The next section combines them into a quadratically-constrained quadratic program, a purely mathematical expression of the temporal instanton analysis goal. A full analysis entails solving this QCQP for each line in the given network.

\subsection{Transmission Line Heating}\label{sec:models-heat}
To find wind patterns that cause a transmission line to sag, we must connect power flows to line temperatures, and constrain a particular line's temperature to be equal to its limit value by the last time step of optimization.

Transmission line temperature dynamics are  Our heating model is derived from \cite{ieee2013}. It is a recursive relationship between initial and final line temperatures based on angle differences at all time steps under consideration. The appendix acts as a bridge between our model and \cite{ieee2013}.

Consider a time horizon with $T$ intervals, each on the order of ten minutes long. Power flow data is updated after each interval, but all other parameters remain constant. Choose a single transmission line in the network ---suppose it lies between nodes $i$ and $j$--- and let this line's thermal limit be represented by $T_\text{lim}$ ($^\circ$C). We can constrain the line's temperature at the end of the $T$-th interval to be equal to this limiting value by enforcing the second-order constraint
\begin{align}\label{eq:tempconstraint}
\sum_{k=1}^n \hat{\theta}_{ij}(t_k)^2 &= \frac{a}{c}\left(T_\text{lim} - f\right),

\subsection{Wind Forecast Inaccuracy}\label{sec:models-wind}
The output of temporal instanton analysis is a set of wind patterns, each of which is the most likely pattern to overheat a particular line in the network. A wind pattern is generally more likely to occur the closer it is to the forecast, but spatial and temporal correlation prevent us from using this intuitive model.

Consider several wind farms scattered across a transmission grid. Each wind site has a forecast power output. Let the error in this forecast be represented by a zero-mean Gaussian random variable.\footnote{Forecast errors are commonly assumed to be Gaussian, but in reality they are better modeled by Cauchy distributions; see \cite{hodge2011}.} Then for any instant in time, the collection of wind forecast errors across the network takes the form of a Gaussian random vector. Elements of this vector are correlated due to spatial relationships between wind sites: if wind speed increases at one site, for instance, a simultaneous decrease at a neighboring site is unlikely. Temporal instanton analysis considers multiple time steps, which introduces temporal correlation. Increased wind at one site during the current time interval may be correlated with greater wind speed at downwind sites during the following interval. Other sources of uncertainty (e.g. hydro generation, demand) may be considered as readily as wind, but may not exhibit spatial or temporal correlation. Thus, the model we use may be simplified to consider other sources of uncertainty.

Suppose a network has $N_R$ wind sites and we wish to consider $T$ time intervals. Let $dev$ be the $(N_R\cdot T)\times 1$ vector of forecast deviations across all wind sites and time intervals. The first $T$ elements of $dev$ contain forecast errors for the first site at time intervals $1-T$, the second $T$ elements are errors for the second site, and so on. The probability density function for $dev$ is
\begin{align*}
f(dev) &= \frac{\exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} dev^\top \mathbf{C}^{-1} dev \right)}{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}\sqrt{\det \mathbf{C}}}~,
\end{align*}
where $\mathbf{C}$ is the correlation matrix. Maximizing $f$ corresponds to minimizing $dev^\top \mathbf{C}^{-1} dev$. Thus, one may express a desire to maximize wind pattern likelihood with
\begin{align}
\label{eq:obj}\min~ dev^\top \mathbf{Q} dev,
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{C}^{-1}$ is the precision matrix. There are many ways to determine $\mathbf{C}$ or $\mathbf{Q}$ from historical data. The authors of \cite{tastu2015} use maximum likelihood optimization to fit eleven parameters to observed data (more parameters may be added if greater accuracy is required). The approximate precision matrix produced by this method is sparse. Of course, one may simply compute a sample correlation matrix from time series data.

% (In the notation of \eqref{eq:optobj}, $dev$ becomes $z_1$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ becomes $\mathbf{Q}_Z$.)

% TODO: generate a sensible precision matrix for the Polish network. Write ML best-fit code. Get some "typical" data from Yury that we can refer to. We just want something that makes sense. We are not inventing anything here.

% TODO: assume no correlation; then we get X. Now use generated precision matrix and get Y. Interpret results briefly.

% Connection with Jon: MPC to ensure line temps don't go too high. How to ensure feasibility? How do we know whether we have enough control effort to keep the temps down? He can use instanton analysis to find the minimal control effort needed to drive the temp back down. No correlation in this case; just want to establish the minimal amount of controllability required.

%There are many ways to obtain $\mathbf{Q}$ contains the same information as $\mathbf{C}$, but there are two advantages to the precision matrix perspective. First, it is possible to generate a precision matrix by fitting a small collection of parameters to observed data; it is not necessary to consider every pair of random variables. The following parameters, when combined with the wind site spatial layout, are sufficient to characterize a precision matrix:
%\begin{align*}
%p &= \left[ \kappa_1,\rho,\kappa_K,\sigma^2,a_{-1},b_0,b_{-1},b_1,c_0,c_{-1},c_1\right]^\top
%\end{align*}
%Second, \cite{tastu2015} showed that a good approximation to the precision matrix consists of tridiagonal blocks, implying that $\mathbf{Q}$ sparse. We refer the reader to \cite{tastu2015} for a detailed description of precision matrix generation. A brief overview of the steps will suffice for this paper. 

%The first step is to encode the spatial layout of the network's wind farms so each site has at most four neighbors: North, South, West, and East. Figure \ref{fig:rts96adjacency_journal} illustrates spatial relationships for our modified RTS-96 network, whose eighteen wind sites are distributed across three uncorrelated areas.

%\label{fig:rts96adjacency_journal}
%\end{figure}

%According to \cite{tastu2015}, one may generate a sufficiently accurate precision matrix by considering only adjacent neighbors and time steps for each site. Thus, for a site A at time $t$, one need only consider the behavior of its (at most four) neighbors at times $t-1$, $t$, and $t+1$; and behavior at the site itself for times $t-1$ and $t+1$. The requirement that $Q$ be positive definite further reduces the number of calculations one must perform. Ultimately, all calculations are based on the previously-described vector of parameters $p$. Maximum-likelihood estimation may be used to find a value for $p$ that fits observed wind data.

%$N_R$ times:
%
%\begin{align*}

\subsection{Network Model}\label{sec:models-network}
Undesirable scenarios found by temporal instanton analysis are of no consequence if they are infeasible. We use the DC power flow assumptions to model power balance and ensure all generation patterns are realistic. These assumptions imply a flat voltage profile, negligible line resistance (though resistance values are used to calculate line temperatures), and linearity of the sine function. The other noteworthy detail of our power network model is distributed slack. The mismatch between total power generation and demand at any time step is divided over multiple generators according to a vector of participation factors. This slack model is more realistic than the single slack bus, which assumes one generator compensates for all mismatch. (Of course, there is still an angle reference bus $\theta_{ref}$.)

The three models described in this section are sufficient to express temporal instanton analysis mathematically. The next section combines them into a QCQP.

\section{Temporal Instanton QCQP}\label{sec:qcqp}
The following quadratically constrained quadratic program is a concise expression of our desire to find feasible, likely wind patterns that will cause one transmission line in the network to reach its temperature limit by the end of a certain time horizon:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:qcqp}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:qcqp-obj}\underset{dev}{\min} \quad & dev^\top \mathbf{Q} dev \\
\nonumber \text{subject to:} & \\
\label{eq:qcqp-flow} \sum_j Y_{ij} \theta_{ij,t} & = G_{i,t} + (R_{i,t} +
dev_{i,t}) - D_{i,t} \\[-8pt]
\nonumber &\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad \forall i \in 1... N,~t\in 1... T \\%[6pt]
\label{eq:qcqp-conv} G_t &= G_{0,t} + k\alpha_t \quad\: \forall t\in 1\ldots T \\
\label{eq:qcqp-ref} \theta_{ref,t} & = 0 \qquad\qquad\quad\; \forall t\in 1\ldots T \\
\label{eq:qcqp-temp} T_{ij}[T] &= T_{ij}^\text{lim}\qquad\quad\: \text{for some }(i,j)\in \mathcal{G}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%\begin{itemize}
%\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
%
%\item $dev_{i,t}$ is the wind output forecast error at wind-farm $i$ and time $t$. Thus, $dev_t$ is shorthand for the vector of errors at time $t$, and $dev$ denotes the vector of all forecast errors across all time steps.
%
%\item $\mathbf{Q}$ is the precision matrix (or inverse covariance matrix) that encodes spatial and temporal relationships between wind sites.
%
%\item $Y_{ij}$ is the $(i,j)$-th element of the admittance matrix, which assumes zero resistance.
%
%\item $\theta_{ij,t}$ is the difference between voltage angles $\theta_i$ and $\theta_j$ at time $t$.
%
%\item $G_{i,t}$ is conventional active power generation at node $i$ and time $t$, and $G_t$ is a vector including all nodes.
%
%\item $R_{i,t}$ is renewable generation forecast at bus $i$ and time $t$.
%
%\item $D_{i,t}$ is active power demand at bus $i$ and time $t$.
%
%\item $N$ is the number of buses (nodes).
%
%\item $G_{0,t}$ is scheduled conventional active power generation (without droop response).
%
%\item $k$ is the vector of participation factors for conventional generators, with $\sum_i k_i = 1$. (The case where $k_i=1$ corresponds to generator $i$ taking all slack.)
%\item $\alpha_t$ is the power mismatch at time $t$.
%
%\item $\Delta T_{ij}^{lim}$ is the change in temperature that will push line $(i,j)$ to its thermal limit.
%
%\item $\theta_\text{ref}$ is the voltage angle of the reference bus.
%
%\item $\mathcal{G}$ is the set of edges (lines).
%\end{itemize}
In \eqref{eq:qcqp} $N$ represents the number of nodes in the network, $T$ the number of time steps, and $\mathcal{G}$ the set of edges (transmission lines). The objective \eqref{eq:qcqp-obj} matches \eqref{eq:obj} and expresses a desire to find wind patterns that are likely to occur (see Section \ref{sec:models-wind}). In this objective, $dev$ is the vector of wind output forecast errors and $\mathbf{Q}$ is the precision (or inverse covariance) matrix. Constraint \eqref{eq:qcqp-flow} enforces DC power balance. The scalar $Y_{ij}$ is the $[i,j]$-th element of the admittance matrix (which assumes zero resistance); $\theta_{ij,t}$ is the difference between voltage angles $\theta_i$ and $\theta_j$ at time $t$; $G_{i,t}$ is conventional active power generation at node $i$ and time $t$; $R_{i,t} + dev_{i,t}$ is the sum of renewable generation forecast and forecast error for wind node $i$ at time $t$; and $D_{i,t}$ is the power demand for bus $i$ at time $t$. Constraint \eqref{eq:qcqp-conv} implements droop response: scheduled generation at time $t$ is represented by the vector $G_{0,t}$, and each generator $G_i$ compensates for a fraction $k_i$ of total power mismatch $\alpha_t$. Constraint \eqref{eq:qcqp-ref} establishes the angle reference bus. Last is \eqref{eq:qcqp-temp}, which constrains the temperature of a particular line to be equal to its limit at final time $T$. The detailed version of \eqref{eq:qcqp-temp} is \eqref{eq:tempconstraint}, whose details are listed in Section \ref{sec:models-heat}.

The mathematical program \eqref{eq:qcqp} has a quadratic objective function, a set of linear constraints, and a single quadratic constraint. We can emphasize this QCQP form by combining all variables into a single vector $z$ and re-writing \eqref{eq:qcqp}:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:opt}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:optobj} \min\quad z_1^\top &\mathbf{Q} z_1 \\
\label{eq:optlin}s.t.\quad \mathbf{A}z &= b \\
\label{eq:optquad}z_3^\top z_3 &= c
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The objective \eqref{eq:optobj} is equivalent to \eqref{eq:qcqp-obj}, the linear equality constraints \eqref{eq:optlin} represent \eqref{eq:qcqp-flow}-\eqref{eq:qcqp-ref}, and the quadratic equality constraint \eqref{eq:optquad} is equivalent to \eqref{eq:qcqp-temp}. The vector $z$ consists of $(N+N_R+2)T$ variables, where $N$ is the number of nodes, $N_R$ is the number of nodes with wind-farms, and $T$ is the number of time steps. Subscripts are used to distinguish variables: $z_1\in\mathbb{R}^{N_RT}$ contains all wind deviations, $z_2\in\mathbb{R}^{(N+1)T}$ contains angle and mismatch variables, and $z_3\in\mathbb{R}^T$ contains auxiliary angle difference variables involved in line temperature calculation. Note that $N_RT$ of the variables represent deviations from forecast at each wind-farm and time step. There are also $NT$ angle variables (of which $T$ are fixed to zero according to \eqref{eq:qcqp-ref}) and $T$ mismatch variables $\alpha_t$ (one per time step). The last $T$ variables are auxiliary angle difference variables used to convert \eqref{eq:qcqp-temp} into a norm constraint.

Solving \eqref{eq:qcqp} for each line in the network yields a set of instanton candidate wind patterns, each of which will heat a particular line to its thermal limit. Of these candidates, the one that deviates least from the wind forecast (across all time steps) is the instanton wind pattern. The next section contains a solution method for QCQPs of the form \eqref{eq:qcqp}, based on work in \cite{bienstock2014}.

%All constraints except the temperature limit may be grouped into a single linear system $\mathbf{A}z=b$. Setting aside the $T$ auxiliary variables for the moment, the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix has a block diagonal structure where each block consists of $(N+1)$ rows and $(N_R+N)$ columns. The first $N$ rows describe power balance and distributed slack behavior at each node. For node $i$ and time $t$, we fix elements of $\mathbf{A}$ and $b$ to establish
%\begin{equation}\label{pbal}
%\sum\limits_{j} Y_{ij}\theta_{j,t}  = (G_{i,t}^0 + k_i\alpha_t) +
%(R_{i,t} + dev_{i,t}) - D_{i,t}.
%\end{equation}
%The first pair of terms on the right-hand side of \eqref{pbal}
%represents conventional generation with distributed slack (generator
%$i$ is taking a portion $k_i$ of the mismatch $\alpha_t$). The second
%pair of terms is renewable generation: forecast $R_{i,t}$ plus
%deviation $dev_{i,t}$. The final term is demand at node $i$ and time
%$t$. (Note that renewable generation terms are zero for nodes without
%wind-farms.) In addition to the $N$ rows corresponding to \eqref{pbal}
%at the $N$ nodes, there is one additional equation associated with
%time $t$ that fixes the angle reference:
%\begin{equation}\label{mismatch}
%\theta_{ref,t} = 0.
%\end{equation}
%
%The $(N+1)$ rows of $Az=b$ expressed in \eqref{pbal} and
%\eqref{mismatch} pertain to a single time step $t$, with $T$ blocks of
%this form arranged diagonally to form $(N+1)T$ rows of $A$ and the
%corresponding $b$ vector. There is one additional block of $A$ used to
%define auxiliary angle difference variables $\hat{\theta}_{ij,t}$ in
%terms of angle variables $\theta_{i,t}$ and $\theta_{j,t}$ at each
%time step:
%\begin{align}\label{thetahat}
%\hat{\theta}_{ij,t} &= \tau^{\frac{T-t}{2}}(\theta_{i,t} - \theta_{j,t})~.
%\end{align}
%The next subsection explains why these variables are helpful.

%Section \ref{sec:problem} described the temporal instanton problem, Section \ref{sec:optimization} expressed it as a QCQP, and this section defined each component. Next we present a solution method for \eqref{opt}.


\section{QCQP Solution Method}\label{sec:solution}
Temporal instanton analysis is fundamentally more complicated than the instantaneous variety. In the instantaneous setting, a line's power flow is constrained (not its temperature). All constraints are therefore linear. Instead of a QCQP like \eqref{eq:qcqp} one obtains a quadratic program (QP) whose solution matches that of its KKT conditions. Heat-constrained temporal instanton analysis, by contrast, cannot be formulated as a QP. There is no linear expression for resistive losses ---even our approximation \eqref{eq:lossapprox} is second-order in angle difference--- so a line temperature constraint like \eqref{eq:qcqp-temp} must be at least second-order. This means temporal instanton analysis cannot be formulated as anything simpler than a quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP). QCQPs are NP-hard in general; reasonable solutions may exist, but unless the quadratic constraint matrices are positive-definite there is no solution guarantee (see \cite{mehanna2014}). Fortunately, the structure of \eqref{eq:qcqp} permits us to develop a non-iterative solution method.


% TODO: define auxiliary angle variables.


The structure of \eqref{eq:opt} is similar to that of the well-known trust region subproblem. Here we describe a four-step solution method based in part on \cite{bienstock2014}. Several changes of variables may be used to obtain an equivalent form of \eqref{eq:opt} whose solution is straightforward.

\subsection{Translation}\label{sec:solution-translation}
The first step is to change variables from $z$ to $y=z-z^*$, where
$z^*\in\{z:Az=b\}$. This translation transforms $Az=b$ into $Ay=0$. To
prevent the change from introducing a linear term into the quadratic
constraint, we require $z_3^*=0$. To satisfy $Az^*=b$, the subvectors
$z_1^*$ and $z_2^*$ must satisfy,
\[
A \begin{bmatrix} z_1^* \\ z_2^*
\\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = b.
\]
It is straightforward to find a min-norm $z^*$ that satisfies this
constraint by partitioning and factorizing $A$ appropriately. After
translation, the problem becomes
\begin{subequations}\label{opt2}
\begin{align}
\label{opt2:obj} \min\quad y_1^\top &Q_z y_1 + 2 y_1^\top Q_z z_1^* \\
\label{opt2:lin} s.t.\quad Ay &= 0 \\
\label{opt2:quad} y_3^\top y_3 &= c.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{Kernel mapping}\label{sec:solution-kernel}
The form of \eqref{opt2:lin} suggests an intuitive explanation: any
solution to \eqref{opt2} must lie in the nullspace (kernel) of $A$. If
$\dim \mathcal{N}(A) =k$ is the dimension of this nullspace, we can
let $y=Nx$ where the $k$ columns of $N$ span $\mathcal{N}(A)$. (Note
that $x$ does not refer to reactance in this context.) This change of
variables is akin to a rotation, but reduces the problem dimension to
$k$. Partitioning $N$ according to,
\[
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ y_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} N_1
  \\ N_2 \\ N_3 \end{bmatrix} x
\]
allows \eqref{opt2} to be written,
\begin{subequations}\label{opt3}
\begin{align}
\label{opt3:obj} \min\quad  &x^\top (N_1^\top Q_zN_1) x + 2x^\top
(N_1^\top Q_zz_1^*) \\
\label{opt3:quad} s.t.\quad &x^\top N_3^\top N_3 x = c.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
All feasible solutions to \eqref{opt3} lie in the nullspace of $A$, so
the linear constraints are now implicit.

\subsection{Obtaining a norm constraint}\label{sec:solution-norm}
After kernel mapping, the quadratic constraint is no longer a norm
constraint. This can be corrected in two steps. First, perform an
eigendecomposition $N_3^\top N_3 = UDU^\top$ and let $\hat{x} = U^\top
x$. The constraint is diagonal in terms of $\hat{x}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{opt3:rotquad} x^\top N_3^\top N_3 x = \hat{x}^\top D\hat{x}
\end{equation}
where $D$ is diagonal and has at most $T$ nonzero elements, so the
right side of \eqref{opt3:rotquad} may be expanded into:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{x}_1^\top & \hat{x}_2^\top \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \hat{D} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{x}_1 \\ \hat{x}_2
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The second step is to change variables from $\hat{x}$ to $w =
[w_1^\top \; w_2^\top]^\top$. The variables $x$, $\hat{x}$ and $w$ are
related through:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:x_to_w} \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix} &=
\begin{bmatrix} I & 0 \\ 0 & \hat{D}^{1/2} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \hat{x}_1 \\ \hat{x}_2 \end{bmatrix} = K\hat{x} \\
\nonumber \implies w &= KU^\top x.
\end{align}
(Note that $x = UK^{-1}w$ because $UU^\top = I$.) In terms of $w$,
\eqref{opt3:quad} is transformed through \eqref{opt3:rotquad} to give
the form of a norm:
\begin{equation}
\hat{x}^\top D\hat{x} = \hat{x}_2^\top \hat{D}^{1/2}\hat{D}^{1/2}\hat{x}_2
= w_2^\top w_2~.
\end{equation}
Of course, this change of variables must also be applied to the cost function. After substitution and simplification, the full problem becomes:
\begin{subequations}\label{opt4}
\begin{align}
\label{opt4:obj} \min\quad &w^\top Bw + w^\top b \\
\label{opt4:quad} s.t.\quad &w_2^\top w_2 = c
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\[
B= K^{-1}U^\top N_1^\top Q_z N_1 UK^{-1} \text{ and }b=2 K^{-1}U^\top
N_1^\top Q_z z_1^*.
\]

The manipulations in this section have restored the norm structure of
the quadratic constraint. In the next section we use the KKT
conditions of \eqref{opt4} to eliminate $w_1$, the unconstrained part
of $w$. This will allow us to write the objective in terms of $w_2$
only.

\subsection{Eliminating $w_1$}\label{sec:solution-w1}
Note that $w_1$ is unconstrained in \eqref{opt4}. For a fixed $w_2$, we can use the KKT
conditions to find $w_1$ such that the objective is minimized. Begin by
expanding the objective:
\begin{align*}
f(w) &=
\begin{bmatrix} w_1^\top & w_2^\top \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} B_{11} & B_{12} \\ B_{12}^\top & B_{22}\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix} w_1^\top & w_2^\top \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2\end{bmatrix} \\
&=
w_1^\top B_{11}w_1 + 2w_1^\top B_{12}w_2 + w_2^\top B_{22}w_2 \\
&\qquad + w_1^\top b_1 + w_2^\top b_2.
\end{align*}
Next, set the partial derivative with respect to $w_1$ equal to zero:
\begin{align}
\nonumber \frac{\partial f}{\partial w_1} &= 2w_1^\top B_{11} + 2w_2^\top B_{12}^\top + b_1^\top = 0 \\
\label{eq:elimw1} \implies w_1 &= -B_{11}^{-1}\left(B_{12}w_2 +
\frac{1}{2}b_1 \right).
\end{align}
After substitution of \eqref{eq:elimw1}, the objective depends only on $w_2$:
\begin{align*}
f(w_2) &= w_2^\top\left(B_{22} - B_{12}^\top B_{11}^{-1}
B_{12}\right)w_2 \\
&\qquad + w_2^\top (b_2 - B_{12}^\top B_{11}^{-1}b_1).
\end{align*}
%\begin{align*}
%f(w_2) &= w_2^\top\left(B_{22} - B_{12}^\top B_{11}^{-1} B_{12}\right)w_2 +
%w_2^\top (b_2 - B_{12}^\top B_{11}^{-1}b_1) \\
%&\qquad - \frac{1}{4}b_1^\top B_{11}^{-1}b_1
%\end{align*}
(Note that the constant term, which plays no role in minimization, was
omitted.) The full optimization problem becomes:
\begin{subequations}\label{opt5}
\begin{align}
\min\quad & w_2^\top \hat{B}w_2 + w_2^\top \hat{b} \\
\label{opt5:quad} s.t.\quad & w_2^\top w_2 = c,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\[
\hat{B} = B_{22} - B_{12}^\top B_{11}^{-1}B_{12} \text{ and }\hat{b} = b_2 - B_{12}^\top B_{11}^{-1}b_1.
\]
This is a QCQP in $T$ dimensions with a single norm constraint. It is
straightforward to obtain solutions to this problem, as the next
subsection shows.

\subsection{Solution via Enumeration}\label{sec:solution-enumeration}
A straightforward method of solving \eqref{opt5} involves initially
diagonalizing $\hat{B}$ through an eigendecomposition. It will be
assumed that step has been completed. Let $v$ be the Lagrange multiplier associated with \eqref{opt5:quad} and write the first-order optimality condition for \eqref{opt5}:
\begin{align}
\nonumber \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(w_2,v)}{\partial w_2} &= 2\hat{B}w_2 + \hat{b} - v(2w_2) = 0 \\
\label{opt5:kkt} \implies \hat{B}w_2 + \frac{1}{2}\hat{b} &= vw_2~.
\end{align}
Equation \eqref{opt5:kkt} is a linear system that yields $w_2$ for fixed $v$:
\begin{equation}
\label{opt5:kkt2}w_{2,i} = \frac{\hat{b}_i/2}{v - \hat{B}_{i,i}}~.
\end{equation}
In addition to satisfying \eqref{opt5:kkt2}, an optimal $w_2$ must
satisfy the quadratic constraint. Substituting \eqref{opt5:kkt2} into
\eqref{opt5:quad} yields the ``secular equation'' (see
\cite{bienstock2014}):
\begin{equation}
s(v) = \sum_{i}\left( \frac{\hat{b}_i /2}{v - \hat{B}_{i,i}}\right)^2 = c.
\end{equation}
Note that $s(v)$ has one pole per unique nonzero diagonal element of
$\hat{B}$. There are at most two solutions per pole, one on each
side. This is best understood graphically. Figure \ref{fig:secular}
illustrates a three-pole secular equation taken from analysis of the
RTS-96 network. The Lagrange multiplier $v$ is on the horizontal axis,
and the secular equation value $s(v)$ is on the vertical. Solutions
are intersections of $s(v)$ with the horizontal line $s(v)=c$. They
can be computed numerically with a simple binary search algorithm.


\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
% follow structure of solution method section.

Temporal instanton analysis consists of solving a number of nearly-identical QCQPs equal to the number of lines in the given network. Section \ref{sec:solution} described a transformation-based solution method for these optimization problems; no iterative scheme is required. Processing and memory requirements are predominantly determined by the number of nodes in the network (size of each QCQP) and the number of lines (total number of QCQPs that must be solved). For networks with thousands of nodes and lines, temporal instanton analysis requires solving thousands of QCQPs, each containing  Careful implementation is required to make the method scale well.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use sparse methods to build QCQP matrices. This makes a dramatic difference in storage requirements. As an example, the $Q_\theta$ matrix for RTS-96 temporal instanton analysis with six time intervals requires 2.5 MB in dense form; a sparse representation occupies just 40 bytes.
    \item Use sparse methods for matrix multiplication, concatenation, and factorization. Maintain sparsity from start to finish. Any step that uses a dense matrix representation will be a bottleneck, especially for larger networks.
    \item Parallelize. After the unchanging pieces of QCQP are built, the remainder of analysis consists of building smaller matrices and performing various transormations for each line in the network. Each line's analysis is independent from all others, so a parallel for loop is a great way to spread computation across multiple processors. After experimenting with anywhere from one to five worker processes on a four-core laptop, we decided that the best processing time/memory allocation tradeoff is to use two processors. This cut overall computation time in half with just a modest increase in memory allocation.
\end{itemize}

Translation, the first step of the QCQP solution method, is computationally expensive and relies on the $A$ matrix having full row rank. Unfortunately, $A$ can have linearly dependent rows for some lines in certain networks.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
We used data from \cite{pandzic} to demonstrate temporal instanton
analysis on a wind-augmented RTS-96 network model. 
%Consider a scenario
%unfolding over three time steps: first the wind forecast is 50\% of
%some nominal value, next it is equal to the nominal value, and finally
%it is scaled to 150\% of nominal. Throughout this wind ramping,
%generator dispatch and demand remain constant. Temporal instanton
%analysis with $c=0.03$ and $\tau=0.5$ indicates that the line between
%buses 121 and 325 is most susceptible to excessive heating under these
%conditions. In other words, of all dangerous wind patterns that could
%occur during the wind ramp, the most likely is a pattern that
%overheats the line between buses 121 and 325. Figure~\ref{fig:secular}
%illustrates the secular equation used to find this instanton pattern,
%and Figure~\ref{fig:line118} shows the system state at the second time
%step. The largest deviation in the instanton pattern is $0.73$ pu,
%well within the range of wind forecast values (whose maximum is $1.2$
%pu).

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
%The paper has extended instanton analysis to consider the temperature
%dynamics of overloaded lines. The resulting formulation is a
%quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP)\@. A
%computationally cheap algorithm has been developed for obtaining
%candidate solutions of this QCQP\@.  There is a great deal of
%flexibility in the temporal instanton model that has yet to be
%explored. In future work we plan to include transformers, consider the
%effects of ambient conditions in greater detail, and test the limits
%of the algorithm using larger networks with many time steps.

\subsection{Heat Balance Equation}
The change in temperature of any object may be expressed as a differential equation called the heat balance equation, which relates temperature change to a sum of various sources of heating. The IEEE 738 standard \cite{ieee2013} provides the following heat balance equation for a transmission line:

\begin{align}\label{eq:heatbalance}
\frac{dT}{dt} &= \frac{1}{m\cdot C_p}\left[I^2\cdot R(T) - q_c - q_r + q_s \right]
\end{align}
where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $T$ is the conductor average temperature.
	\item $m\cdot C_p$ is the product of mass and heat capacity.
	\item $I^2\cdot R(T)$ represents heat rate due to resistive heating. In this paper the term is replaced by $f_{ij}^\text{loss}$, the DC approximate line loss expression derived in \cite{almassalkhi2014}:
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:lossapprox}
	f_{ij}^{\text{loss}} \approx r_{ij}\left(\frac{\theta_{ij}}{x_{ij}}\right)^2,
	\end{equation}
	where $\theta_{ij}$ is the difference between angles
	$\theta_i$ and $\theta_k$, and $r_{ij} +j x_{ij}$ is the impedance of
	the line between nodes $i$ and $j$. Three assumptions underpin
	\eqref{eq:lossapprox}: voltage magnitudes are all 1~pu, cosine may be
	approximated by its second-order Taylor expansion, and $x_{ij} \geq
	4r_{ij}$. Thus, \eqref{eq:lossapprox} uses DC power flow assumptions
	to approximate line losses, but remains nonlinear.
	\item $q_c$ is the rate of heat loss due to convection. Any object at a higher temperature than surrounding air will gradually cool as the air carries heat away. This phenomenon is proportional to the temperature difference between the line and surrounding air:
		\begin{align}\label{eq:qc}
		q_c &= \eta_c\cdot(T - T_\text{amb})~,
		\end{align}
	where $T_\text{amb}$ is the ambient temperature (of surrounding air).
	\item $q_r$ is the rate of heat loss due to radiation. Thermal radiation is the process by which thermal energy is converted to electromagnetic energy in all objects with non-zero absolute temperature. It is modeled by a fourth-order expression:
	  \begin{align}\label{eq:qr}
	    q_r &= \eta_r\cdot\left[(T + 273)^4 - (T_\text{amb} + 273)^4\right]
	  \end{align}
	\item $q_s$ is the rate of heat gain due to solar heating. In this paper the solar heat rate is fixed to some conservative constant (representing full direct sun), but it is important to note that solar heat rate varies significantly with cloud cover, geometry, and even insulation type (reflective versus black).
\end{itemize}
%\begin{align}\label{eq:738heatbalance}
%\frac{dT_\text{avg}}{dt} &= \frac{1}{mC_p}\left( r_{ij}\frac{\theta_{ij}^2}{x_{ij}^2}\frac{S_b}{3L_{ij}} - q_c - q_r + q_s\right)
%\end{align}

\subsection{Linearization of Radiation Heat Rate}
When \eqref{eq:heatbalance} is combined with an initial temperature $T_0$, the resulting initial value problem makes it possible to determine the temperature at any later time. We substitute \eqref{eq:qc} and \eqref{eq:qr} into \eqref{eq:heatbalance} and attempt to solve for temperature:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:heatbalance_approx}
\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{1}{mC_p}\big[ f_{ij}^\text{loss} - \eta_c\left( T(t) - T_\text{amb}\right) \\ - \eta_r\left((T(t) + 273)^4 - (T_\text{amb} + 273)^4\right) + q_s \big]
\end{multline}

Suppose that power flow, ambient temperature, and solar heat rate are constant during a temperature change calculation. Then there are just two variable terms on the right-hand side: one first-order and the other fourth-order. The fourth-order term (which comes from $q_r$) makes this equation difficult to solve. Fortunately, $q_r$ is approximately linear over the temperature range we are interested in (from ambient temperature to temperature limit). We replace $q_r$ by $\tilde{q}_r$, a conservative\footnote{Because a transmission line is hotter than surrounding air, radiation tends to decrease line temperature. Thus, a conservative approach will underestimate the radiation heat rate, leading to slightly higher temperatures.} linearization:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:approx_rad}
\tilde{q}_r = \eta_r  \left( (T_\text{mid} + 273)^4 - (T_\text{amb} + 273)^4\right) + \\ 4\eta_r(T_\text{mid} + 273)^3\cdot(T(t) - T_\text{mid})
\end{multline}

\subsection{Line Temperature as Recursive Relationship}
Substitution of \eqref{eq:approx_rad} into \eqref{eq:heatbalance_approx} yields the approximate heat balance equation
\begin{align}\label{eq:diffeq}
\frac{dT}{dt} &= aT(t) + b~,
\end{align}
where constants $a$ and $b$ are defined as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
a &= \frac{1}{mC_p} \left[ -\eta_c - 4\eta_r(T_\text{mid} + 273)^3 \right]
\end{align}
\begin{multline}
b = \frac{1}{mC_p} \big[ f_{ij}^\text{loss} + \eta_cT_\text{amb} - \eta_r \big( (T_\text{mid} + 273)^4 \\ - (T_\text{amb} + 273)^4 \big) + 4\eta_rT_\text{mid}(T_\text{mid} + 273)^3 + q_s \big]
\end{multline}
\end{subequations}

Our approximate heat balance initial value problem \eqref{eq:diffeq} has a straightforward solution:

\begin{align}\label{eq:tivp}
T(t) &= ke^{at} - \frac{b}{a}
\end{align}

where $k=T(0) + b/a$. Note that $b$ is influenced by power flow (via
$f_{ij}^\text{loss}$), but $a$ is not.

The only variables in \eqref{eq:tivp} are initial temperature and angle differences during each time interval. There is therefore a recursive relationship between final temperature and initial temperature that involves only angle differences. The derivation of this recursive relationship is an exercise in messy linear algebra; it is omitted here for brevity.
%Suppose there are three time intervals: $t_1$, $t_2$, and $t_3$. Then the line temperature at the end of the third interval is given by
%
%\begin{align}
%\nonumber T(t_3) &= k_3 e^{(t_3-t_2)a} - \frac{b_3}{a} \\
%\nonumber &= \left[k_2 e^{(t_2-t_1)a} - \frac{b_2}{a} + \frac{b_3}{a}\right]e^{(t_3-t_2)a} - \frac{b_3}{a} \\
%\nonumber &= \left[\left( T(t_1) + \frac{b_2}{a} \right)e^{(t_2-t_1)a} - \frac{b_2}{a} + \frac{b_3}{a}\right]e^{(t_3-t_2)a} - \frac{b_3}{a} \\
%\label{eq:Texpand} &= \Bigg\lbrace\left[\left(T(t_0) + \frac{b_1}{a}\right) \nonumber e^{(t_1-t_0)a} - \frac{b_1}{a} + \frac{b_2}{a}\right]e^{(t_2-t_1)a} \\
%& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad - \frac{b_2}{a} + \frac{b_3}{a}\Bigg\rbrace e^{(t_3-t_2)a} - \frac{b_3}{a}
%\end{align}
%The recursive pattern is apparent. Because all time intervals are the same length, we have
%\begin{align*}
%e^{(t_3-t_2)a} &= e^{(t_2-t_1)a} = e^{(t_1-t_0)a}~,
%\end{align*}
%and we can distribute in \eqref{eq:Texpand} to obtain
%\begin{multline}
%T(t_3) = (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^3\left(T(t_0) + \frac{b_1}{a}\right) \\ + (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^2\left(- \frac{b_1}{a} + \frac{b_2}{a}\right) \\ + (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})\left(- \frac{b_2}{a} + \frac{b_3}{a}\right) - \frac{b_3}{a}
%\end{multline}
%Because power flow data enters through $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$, it makes sense to
%group terms accordingly:
%
%\begin{multline}
%T(t_3) = ((e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^3T(t_0) + \\ \left(\frac{(e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^3}{a} - \frac{(e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^2}{a}\right)b_1 \\ + \left( \frac{(e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^2}{a} - \frac{(e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^1}{a}\right)b_2 \\ + \left(\frac{e^{(t_1-t_0)a}}{a} - \frac{1}{a}\right) b_3
%\end{multline}
%The pattern in the above expression makes it easy to extend $T(t_3)$ to cover the general case $T(t_n)$:
%
%\begin{multline}\label{eq:recursive}
%T(t_n) = (e^{(t_1 - t_0)a})^n T(t_0) \\ + \frac{1}{a} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^i - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{i-1} \right)b_{n-i+1}
%\end{multline}
%
%Ultimately \eqref{eq:recursive} will be used to constrain a line's final temperature to some limiting value. The remainder of this section will relate \eqref{eq:recursive} back to power flow angles so it can be ``plugged in'' to the optimization framework.
%
%\subsection{Relating temperature to angle differences}
%
%Recall that $b_n$ depends on the angle difference at time $t_n$:
%
%\begin{align}
%\nonumber b_n &= \frac{1}{mC_p} \Bigg[ \frac{r_{ij}}{x_{ij}^2}\cdot \frac{S_b}{3L_{ij}} \theta_{ij}(t_n)^2 + \eta_cT_\text{amb} \\
%\nonumber &\qquad - \eta_r\left((T_\text{mid} + 273)^4 - (T_\text{amb} + 273)^4\right) \\
%&\qquad + 4\eta_rT_\text{mid}(T_\text{mid} + 273)^3 + q_s \Bigg] \\
%\label{eq:bexpand} b_n &= c\theta_{ij}(t_n)^2 + d
%\end{align}
%where constants $c$ and $d$ are defined as:
%\begin{align*}
%c &= \frac{r_{ij}S_b}{3 mC_p x_{ij}^2L_{ij}} \\
% d &= \frac{1}{mC_p}\left[ \eta_cT_\text{amb} - \eta_r\left((T_\text{mid} + 273)^4 - (T_\text{amb} + 273)^4\right) + 4\eta_rT_\text{mid}(T_\text{mid} + 273)^3 + q_s \right]
%\end{align*}
%Substitute \eqref{eq:bexpand} into \eqref{eq:recursive}:
%\begin{align*}
%T(t_n) &= (e^{(t_1 - t_0)a})^n T(t_0) + \frac{1}{a} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^i - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{i-1} \right)(c\theta_{ij}(t_{n-i+1})^2 + d)
%\end{align*}
%Expand the sum term:
%\begin{multline}\label{eq:sumexpand}
%\frac{1}{a} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^i - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{i-1} \right)(c\theta_{ij}(t_{n-i+1})^2 + d) = \frac{c}{a}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^i - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{i-1} \right)\theta_{ij}(t_{n-i+1})^2\right] + \\  \qquad + \frac{d}{a}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^i - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{i-1} \right)\right]
%\end{multline}
%Substitute \eqref{eq:sumexpand} into the line temperature equation, introducing the constant $f$ to keep things a bit neater:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:almostthere}
%T(t_n) &= f + \frac{c}{a}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^i - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{i-1} \right)\theta_{ij}(t_{n-i+1})^2\right]
%\end{align}
%where
%\begin{align}
%f &= (e^{(t_1 - t_0)a})^n T(t_0) + \frac{d}{a}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^i - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{i-1} \right)\right]
%\end{align}
%Rearrange \eqref{eq:almostthere} to isolate angle differences:
%\begin{align}
%\sum_{i=1}^n \left( (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^i - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{i-1} \right)\theta_{ij}(t_{n-i+1})^2 &= \frac{a}{c}(T(t_n) - f)
%\end{align}
%Now define
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:thetahat}
%\hat{\theta}_{ij}(t_{k})=  \theta_{ij}(t_k)\sqrt{ (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{n-k+1} - (e^{(t_1-t_0)a})^{n-k} }
%\end{equation}
%to obtain
%\begin{align}\label{eq:finaltemp}
%\sum_{k=1}^n \hat{\theta}_{ij}(t_{k})^2 &= \frac{a}{c}\left(T(t_n) - f\right)
%\end{align}
%The expression \eqref{eq:finaltemp} may be used to constrain line temperature to be equal to some limiting value by the end of the last time interval.
%
%This derivation has been somewhat messy. The line temperature constraint is summarized in the next section for convenience.




%Comparison with the temperature calculation method recommended by IEEE in \cite{ieee2013} shows th To validate the approximate line temperature model derived here, I compared it to the IEEE 738 standard model using RTS-96 and Waxwing conductor parameters.
%
%\subsection{Summary of IEEE 738 temperature calculation}\label{summary-of-ieee-738-temperature-calculation}
%
%IEEE recommends numerically integrating \eqref{eq:heatbalance} to compute temperature changes. The temporal instanton framework uses approximate DC losses in place of $I^2R(T_\text{avg})$, so we will be integrating the following heat balance equation:
%
%\begin{align}\label{eq:738heatbalance}
%\frac{dT_\text{avg}}{dt} &= \frac{1}{mC_p}\left( r_{ij}\frac{\theta_{ij}^2}{x_{ij}^2}\frac{S_b}{3L_{ij}} - q_c - q_r + q_s\right)
%\end{align}
%
%Heat rates $q_c$ and $q_r$ are calculated according to \eqref{eq:qc} and \eqref{eq:qr}, respectively (copied here for convenience):
%\begin{align*}
%q_c &= \eta_c\cdot(T - T_\text{amb}) \\
%q_r &= \eta_r\cdot((T + 273)^4 - (T_\text{amb} + 273)^4)
%\end{align*}
%All other parameters are constant during temperature calculation. The important thing to keep in mind about IEEE 738 temperature calculation is that it requires numerical integration; there is no analytic temperature solution for \eqref{eq:738heatbalance}. This means one must select an integration time step $\Delta t$. For each step, one computes the change in temperature by multiplying $\Delta t$ by the value of \eqref{eq:738heatbalance} computed at that step. IEEE recommends a step size smaller than 10\% of the conductor thermal time constant\footnote{A typical transmission line thermal time constant is ten minutes, which means IEEE recommends an integration step size of one minute}. A smaller integration step size yields more accurate results.
%
%\subsection{Comparison}\label{comparison}

%
%The blue trace in Figure \ref{fig:temp_model_comparison2} results from numerical integration of \eqref{eq:738heatbalance} with a 1s step size. The green trace comes from the approximate model derived in Section \ref{transmission-line-heating}. The green dot is the final temperature computed by \eqref{eq:almostthere}.
%
%Notes:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%  Because the approximate line temperature model is analytic (Equation \eqref{eq:tivp} is continuous) while the 738 model requires numerical integration, I chose
%  a very small integration step size of one second to facilitate comparison.
%\item
%  Because the approximate model underestimates the radiative heat loss
%  rate (see Figure \ref{fig:rad_approx}), the green trace should lie slightly above the blue one. This
%  makes the approximate model conservative, which is desirable in the
%  temporal instanton setting. Figure \ref{fig:temp_model_comparison2} illustrates this conservative behavior: the green trace lies on or above the blue trace throughout the time horizon.
%  \item The green dot, computed by \eqref{eq:almostthere}, lies on top of the green curve. This validates the temperature constraint formulation \eqref{eq:tempconstraint}.
%\end{itemize}


%Section \ref{sec:line-losses} describes an approximate line loss formulation that forms the basis of a dynamical model developed in Section \ref{sec:temp-dynamics}. Finally, Section \ref{sec:instanton-formulation} incorporates line temperature dynamics into a complete mathematical model.

%The equations governing AC power flow are nonlinear. If we use these equations to balance the power flows in our optimization, the resulting feasible region will be nonconvex. Previous instanton work has addressed this issue by replacing the AC power flow equations with DC equations (the DC power flow equations assume that the network is lossless, with all voltage magnitudes equal to 1 per unit). This substitution renders the feasible region of instanton optimization (in the absence of nonlinear constraints) convex.

%There are two primary difficulties associated with time-coupled instanton analysis. First, every active and reactive power flow is related to all variables involved in the flow:  the voltage magnitudes at both nodes and the angle difference between them. If we allow this tight coupling into our optimization framework, there will be no guarantee of a unique solution, or indeed of any solution at all. The second difficulty arises from the equation for power loss. Power loss on a line is proportional to the square of the current through it. This nonlinear relationship leads to nonconvexity in the optimization problem's feasible region. In this paper we address the first concern by using the DC power flow, and we sidestep the second difficulty by using a piecewise-continuous convex relaxation of the power loss equation.
