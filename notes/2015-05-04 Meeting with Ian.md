Meeting with Ian

Updates

* Quals 2 light on results: still working on this. Plan to have much more detailed results in presentation.

* Liberally add references to Quals 2 report: There weren't many to add. I suppose I could add more optimization references.

* Line temperature: break time horizon into ten-minute intervals.

* Send Ian results portion of Quals 2 presentation. Get it to him in the next few days.

* Connect objective function with probability; weight earlier time steps.

1. Nail down line temperature formulation.

2. Express results in a way Ian can understand. Make sure I can convince committee and reviewers.  Show how this achieves results that cannot be found any other way.

3. What's the meaning of the cost function? Shouldn't earlier steps be weighted more? There's autocorrelation and cross-correlation, as well as exponential increase in uncertainty.

4. Introduce wind generation non-negativity constraints.

Submit this before PowerTech.

It's not just putting in time; it's thinking critically; questioning what is going on. Creativity!
