## Update

Code can generate each piece of the temporal instanton problem.

## Work to be done

* Solve the problem! Massage further into "trust region subproblem" format.

* Introduce new variables representing angle difference? Shouldn't be necessary.

* Use ARPA data from multiple hours

* Include plot of secular equation in paper.
