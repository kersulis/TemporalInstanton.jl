Thus, in addition to reducing the number of lines that must be analyzed, an ISF pre-check should make it possible to speed up the analysis of remaining lines."

The first step in temporal instanton analysis is to translate the problem by a vector $x^*$, where $A_1x_1^* + A_2x_2^* = 0$. To find $x^*$, I needed to compute the pseudo-inverse of $Z = [A_1~~A_2]^\\top$. The line in question is\n",

    "## Physical intuition\n",
    "The `case9` network has a central ring (4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4) and three dangling nodes (1,2,3). Each dangling node has a generator, but in the Matpower data one of the generators (at node 1) is dispatched to zero. I converted the generator at node 3 into a wind farm, so **the only conventional generation node was node 2**. This effectively renders node 2 the slack bus. The only generation sources are at node 2 and any nodes where I place wind generation. If I introduce just one wind farm and place it at node 2, it doesn't matter what line we consider; there is no way for renewable generation changes to influence line flows.\n",

    "Suppose a network has $N$ nodes and $L$ lines. Let $D_{nz}$ be a $L\\times N$ matrix. Now consider each pairing of a line $l$ with a node $n$. Place a single wind farm at $n$ and form the $Z$ matrix. If $Z^\\top Z$ is singular, let $D_{nz}[l,n] = 0$. Otherwise, let $D_{nz}[l,n] = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see if we can replicate $D_{nz}$ using injection shift factors. The ISF matrix has the same dimensions as $D_{nz}$. It contains positive and negative elements, and some elements may be fairly small. Take the absolute value of the ISF matrix. Now replace every element greater than some epsilon by 1, and replace every other element with zero. Call this modified ISF matrix $I_{nz}$. Like $D_{nz}$, it is a $L\\times N$ matrix of zeros and ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "I computed $D_{nz}$ and $I_{nz}$ for `case9` and `case118`. They were identical in both cases. For `case9` it is easy to add and move generators and change their participation factors, so I made a variety of changes. No matter how I moved generators around, $I_{nz}$ exactly matched $D_{nz}$. This suggests that I can use the ISF matrix to predict whether $Z$ will be rank-deficient."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Every rank deficiency for `case9` is explained by injection shift factors. This motivates a pre-check: before performing temporal instanton analysis, I will build the ISF matrix and look at columns corresponding to renewable nodes. A row of zeros in this matrix indicates that the corresponding line is completely insensitive to changes in renewable generation. Such a line should be neglected in temporal instanton analysis; there is no change in wind that could cause it to reach its temperature limit. Having filtered out these lines, I can perform temporal instanton analysis on the remaining ones."
