    "The change in temperature of any object may be expressed as a differential equation. This equation, called the heat balance equation, relates change in temperature to a sum of various sources of heating. For a transmission line, these sources are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Resistive heating, also known as $I^2R$ losses. This heat source is a function of power flow on the line. In general, the line's resistance varies with temperature, making this calculation more complicated than it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convective heating, which is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the line and the surrounding air. If the line is hotter than the surrounding air, it will \"give off heat\" via convection -- particles moving away from the line will carry energy with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Radiative heating. This heating is related to line and ambient temperatures raised to the fourth power. Physically, thermal radiation is the process by which thermal energy is converted to electromagnetic energy. It takes place in all objects whose abosolute temperature is greater than zero.\n",

    "* Solar irradiation. The sun imparts energy to the transmission line according. The magnitude of this energy transfer is a function of clouds, geometry, and the line's insulation material. Reflective insulation admits very little solar energy, while black insulation results in significant solar thermal heating."
