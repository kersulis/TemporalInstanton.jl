    "# Parallelizing the `for` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual matrix inversion and sparsity have led to great performance gains, but more can be accomplished. Perhaps the greatest source of potential is the single `for` loop that runs through each line in the network. There is no need for one process to handle every line in series, but the way the code is currently written precludes parallelization.\n",

    "I begin the re-write by deleting old versions of the temporal instanton code. One of the greatest things about version control is that you don't need to be sentimental.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files `TemporalInstanton3` and `PowerFlow` are the only ones I currrently use. Everything else contains duplicate or inferior code."
