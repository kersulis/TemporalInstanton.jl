    "It would be nice to avoid solving a nonconvex QCQP with a shell constraint. What if, instead of minimizing wind deviations, we fixed a wind forecast inaccuracy limit (placing bounds on deviation variables) and maximized heat input to each line? This would give us a set of wind patterns, each one based on $x\\%$ maximum forecast inaccuracy, that would maximally heat one line in the network. We could then filter that list based on which line temperatures are greatest, and sort remaining patterns according to distance from the forecast. In the end, we would have the most likely wind pattern (assuming inaccuracy of $x\\%$) guaranteed to saturate a line."

This gives us a set of system states (including wind deviations), each of which reflects maximal heating of one line in the network subject to the given forecast inaccuracy.\n",

If $T_{ik}^* \\geq T_{ik}^{max}$, we have a problem. Otherwise, there is no wind pattern within the forecast inaccuracy limits that will excessively heat line $(i,k)$. We remove $z_{ik}^*$ from our list and move on.\n",

Otherwise, we rank members of the set according to $\\lVert x_{ik}^*\\rVert$, the normed distance between the forecast and the actual wind pattern. This gives us a set of \"extreme events\" sorted roughly by likelihood (since patterns closer to the forecast are more likely to occur)."
