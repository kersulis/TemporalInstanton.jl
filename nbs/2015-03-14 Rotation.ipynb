The purpose of this rotation is to diagonalize the objective matrix, turning the first-order optimality conditions into a secular equation (which is easy to solve). The appropriate diagonalizing rotation matrix is $R_{eigvec}$, whose columns are Eigenvectors of the objective matrix. Here is what $R_{eigvec}$ looks like:\n",

But this condition is insufficient to ensure that the last $T$ components have a norm of $c$ in the original coordinate system (when we transform back). This explains why the solutions I obtain do not satisfy $x^\\top Q_\\theta x = c$ even though they solve the secular equation.\n",
