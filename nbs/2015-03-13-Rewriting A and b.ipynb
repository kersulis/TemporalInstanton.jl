This is foolish in light of the very nature of the power balance equations: there is no explicit equation for any of the variables, yet every vector in the set $\\{x:Ax=b\\}$ assigns reasonable values to all of them. We do not solve the power balance equations for any particular variable. We simply write the equations out using the appropriate variables and stack everything up in matrix-vector form. Solutions come out according to linear algebra.\n",
